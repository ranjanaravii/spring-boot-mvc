# Project Title

This is a Java-based project that uses Maven and Spring Boot. It consists of three services: `Order Service`, `Inventory Service`, and `Product Service`.

## Services

1. **Order Service**: Handles customer orders. It receives an order request, checks the availability of the ordered items from the Inventory Service, calculates the total price, and finally saves the order.

2. **Inventory Service**: Manages the inventory of products. It maintains the quantity of each product available in the inventory.

3. **Product Service**: Manages the details of the products, such as name, description, and price. The Order Service might call the Product Service to get the price of the products when an order is placed.
